API-initiated flows expect `application/json` to be sent in the body and respond with HTTP 200 and an application/json body with the session token on success; HTTP 302 redirect to a fresh settings flow if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set; HTTP 400 on form validation errors. HTTP 401 when the endpoint is called without a valid session token. HTTP 403 when `selfservice.flows.settings.privileged_session_max_age` was reached. Implies that the user needs to re-authenticate.  Browser flows expect `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` to be sent in the body and responds with a HTTP 302 redirect to the post/after settings URL or the `return_to` value if it was set and if the flow succeeded; a HTTP 302 redirect to the Settings UI URL with the flow ID containing the validation errors otherwise. a HTTP 302 redirect to the login endpoint when `selfservice.flows.settings.privileged_session_max_age` was reached.  More information can be found at [Ory Kratos User Settings & Profile Management Documentation](../self-service/flows/user-settings).

    // Complete Verification Flow
    //
    // Use this endpoint to complete a verification flow. This endpoint behaves differently for API and browser flows and has several states:  `choose_method` expects `flow` (in the URL query) and `email` (in the body) to be sent and works with API- and Browser-initiated flows. For API clients it either returns a HTTP 200 OK when the form is valid and HTTP 400 OK when the form is invalid and a HTTP 302 Found redirect with a fresh verification flow if the flow was otherwise invalid (e.g. expired). For Browser clients it returns a HTTP 302 Found redirect to the Verification UI URL with the Verification Flow ID appended. `sent_email` is the success state after `choose_method` when using the `link` method and allows the user to request another verification email. It works for both API and Browser-initiated flows and returns the same responses as the flow in `choose_method` state. `passed_challenge` expects a `token` to be sent in the URL query and given the nature of the flow (\"sending a verification link\") does not have any API capabilities. The server responds with a HTTP 302 Found redirect either to the Settings UI URL (if the link was valid) and instructs the user to update their password, or a redirect to the Verification UI URL with a new Verification Flow ID which contains an error message that the verification link was invalid.

    // Check Who the Current HTTP Session Belongs To
    //
    // Uses the HTTP Headers in the GET request to determine (e.g. by using checking the cookies) who is authenticated. Returns a session object in the body or 401 if the credentials are invalid or no credentials were sent. Additionally when the request it successful it adds the user ID to the 'X-Kratos-Authenticated-Identity-Id' header in the response.  This endpoint is useful for:  AJAX calls. Remember to send credentials and set up CORS correctly! Reverse proxies and API Gateways Server-side calls - use the `X-Session-Token` header!

    // Update an Identity
    //
    // This endpoint updates an identity. It is NOT possible to set an identity's credentials (password, ...) using this method! A way to achieve that will be introduced in the future.  The full identity payload (except credentials) is expected. This endpoint does not support patching.  Learn how identities work in [Ory Kratos' User And Identity Model Documentation](https://www.ory.sh/docs/next/kratos/concepts/identity-user-model).
